# README

## Overview

This repository contains logs related to the installation, activation, disabling, and deactivation of an eSIM. The logs are split into two directories based on their source:

---

## Folder Descriptions

### `logcat/`
- This folder contains logs captured directly from the **phone side**.
- The logs were collected using the `logcat` tool on a **Linux machine**.
- These logs represent device-side events and system outputs during eSIM lifecycle operations.

### `mme-export.log`
- This file contains logs captured from the **Amarisoft Classical Callbox**.
- The logs reflect network-side signaling during **eSIM installation, activation, disabling, and deactivation**.
- These logs were captured during a **previous session**, and are provided here for comparison and analysis alongside the more recent phone-side logs.

## Usage

These logs are intended for research, debugging, and analysis purposes related to eSIM behavior on both the device and network side.

If you use or refer to these logs in a project or publication, please cite appropriately.
